# Lab 01

This first week of labs will refresh your memory on deep learning with PyTorch and.

If you have never worked with PyTorch before or need to refresh your memory on how to work with tensors, autograd, how to build neural networks with PyTorch, or how to train a classifier, start with Lab 1a.

If you are already familiar with PyTorch, start directly with Labs 1b and 1c. This week's labs are intended to be run in Google Colab or your own device - this will change in the following labs!
