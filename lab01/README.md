# Lab 01

This first week of labs will refresh your memory on deep learning with PyTorch.

If you have never worked with PyTorch before or need to refresh your memory on how to work with tensors, autograd, how to build neural networks with PyTorch, or how to train a classifier, start with Lab 1a.

If you are already familiar with PyTorch, start directly with Labs 1b and 1c. This week's labs are intended to be run in Google Colab or your own device using Jupyter.

| Lab | Topic | Link |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1a | Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz  (Tensors, Autograd, NNs, Classifiers) | [Part 1][1], [Part 2][2], [Part 3][3], [Part 4][4] |
| 1b | Convolutional Neural Networks | [lab01b](./lab01b.ipynb) |
| 1c | Transformers | [lab01c](./lab01c.ipynb) [(Solution)](./lab01c_sol.ipynb) |

## Further reading

"PyTorch" isn't just the `torch` package - it's a whole ecosystem! Here are a few libraries that might be of interest:

- [`PyTorch Lightning`](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/), a high-level framework built on top of PyTorch.
- [`PyTorch Ignite`](https://pytorch-ignite.ai/), a "high-level library to help with training and evaluating neural networks in PyTorch flexibly and transparently."

You can explore the whole ecosystem over on the [PyTorch Ecosystem Page](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/)! Some of the libraries and tools listed might act as inspiration for your MLOps project later in the semester.
